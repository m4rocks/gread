# GRead

GRead is a web app that turns websites into gruvbox styled
pages that are on the eyes.

## :question: How to

Prefix `gread.deno.dev/` or `gread.notangelmario.dev/` before your
url.

## :sparkles: Features

* Can optionally bypass paywalls
* Gruvbox Light/Dark mode based on system
* Deployed in 30+ regions
* Fast response times

## :unlock: Bypass paywalls

To bypass paywalls, use `gread.deno.dev/cached/URL` 
(URL being your desired url to be viewed).

This grabs a Google cached version the website. The API
has not been tested enough times, so it might not work
sometimes.
